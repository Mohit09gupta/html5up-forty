								<h1>How does EcoHive works?</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="content" style="padding-left: 1em;">
								<p>Using the EcoHive mobile website, commuters are able to book seats on the available bus routes
									in advance. Booking of seats offers predictability and assurance of a seat on the bus. The
									website comes with a tracking feature for passengers to track the bus on the day of the ride.
									Commuters can also suggest new routes on the website. The collated suggestions will allow
									private bus operators to identify the areas with demand for new adaptive routes at competitive
									prices. Bus operators are also provided analytics tools that help them with monitoring of their
									drivers’ movement.
									There are currently 7 private bus operators on EcoHive, more than 70 drivers and 34 EcoHive
									routes running, with plans to include more operators and routes progressively. Since the
									inception of EcoHive, more than 38,000 website downloads were made, with 30,000 route
									suggestions received from the public, and more than 3,800 active monthly bookings.
									As part of EcoHive’s continuous iteration, the service has also pivoted towards the corporate
									collaboration model. Partnership with corporates and private companies, especially to
									provide direct bus routes for their employees’ commute to work, have been key to EcoHive’s
									success</p>
